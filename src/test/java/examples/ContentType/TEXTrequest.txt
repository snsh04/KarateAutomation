Lambda APIs can ONLY be registered through the Pipeline (not manually through the Publisher portal).

A Lambda API is identified by the API Admin when the config.lambda property is set to true.

When mapping the Swagger and Config file to an API definition to register to WSO2, the endpoint property is set to (see note above)

<apiawsps-dns-hostname>/<domain>/<basepath>/<version>
